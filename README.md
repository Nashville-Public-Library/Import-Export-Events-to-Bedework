# Import-Export Events to Bedework

## Description
Every quarter, staff enter events into [Bedework](https://www.apereo.org/projects/bedework) Enterprise Calendaring System. This project is used to distribute those events from the Bedework system to various platforms.
Only organization currently using this system is Nashville Public Library, supplying [NowPlayingNashville](https://www.nowplayingnashville.com/). The process described in this project facilitates the transfer of events from library to Community Foundation using spreadsheet compatible with NPN's calendar system of bulk-uploads.

Entire process is described at [NPL Events Process(Bedework and Unbound)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b_solu5MOM68xtIQ1ApO3Y-CmuEI48UOSN2Mh2Ni_Hc/edit?usp=sharing)

Historically, events had been gathered in multiple Excel spreadsheets and uploaded as ical files. This is no longer local practice. But earlier project files can still facilitate this.

## Installation

### Clean up data in Excel for export to NowPlayingNashville
- You may want to use SORT to group duplicate shows. Confer with CFMT whether they want a show as a single row, or broken out into separate performances.
